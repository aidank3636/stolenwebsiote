Current state of my workflow is written out in [config repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config).

## Tech I use to build things

### Websites

- [React](https://react.dev) to render
- [Jazz](https://jazz.tools) for state
- [Encore](https://encore.dev) TS for backend logic (in TS but sometimes Go too)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) to run TS, scripting, ..
