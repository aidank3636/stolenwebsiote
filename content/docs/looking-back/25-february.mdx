## January 2

Lots of work. Still no money but work is done.

I also recently found out that a friend of mine sold his business for multiple millions whilst I can't even afford ramen.

Jealousy is poison you drink yourself though, so I am super happy for him. I hope when I am 40, I will have at least around 5,000$ net worth but will see.

Right now, I am genuinely wondering why I even try, if nothing ever works out.

No one wants to hire me. I am genuinely useless. All I can hope for at this point is LLMs to get better and somehow use that to make at least something that earns enough money not to starve for most of the days.

It's also fucking crazy how this friend of mine's business is not using any sync engines or anything like that, just pure product market fit, firebase and firestore, no SQL even. That's it. Multi million exit.

Anyway, I should not quit, I think. Getting out of depression often gets helped by being able to change the environment but I can't afford that. I can't afford food, been eating eggs only for most of winter from the chickens my parents do have.

You can make some nice omelettes though so should be grateful for what I do have.

Back to work. I should somehow monetize this.

## January 9

Had a nervous breakdown yesterday from all the stress.

The problem really is not even the lack of money for me. I am ok with starving a bit and the stress from me not having anything.

But it's also my parents. My dad doesn't have a job but has __ideas__ that I am working on. My mom is earning around 1000$ a month on her job which is just enough to cover some bills and my sister.

I am earning 0$ and I am not as depressed about it as I probably should be. I am just stressed as every day its just wake up, have some breakfast (fav part of day), then work. All day, until sleep. Tomorrow same thing.

We have a joke where we treat work as going to zavod (factory in russian), in fairness people worked as hard during WW2 and things too and did not complain. So I won't.

Anyway, back to zavod.
