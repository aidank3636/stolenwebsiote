## January 2

Lots of work. Still no money but work is done.

I also recently found out that a friend of mine sold his business for multiple millions whilst I can't even afford ramen.

Jealousy is poison you drink yourself though, so I am super happy for him. I hope when I am 40, I will have at least around 10,000$ net worth but will see.

Right now, I am genuinely wondering why I even try, if nothing ever works out.

No one wants to hire me. I am genuinely useless. All I can hope for at this point is LLMs to get better and somehow use that to make at least something that earns enough money not to starve for most of the days.

Anyway, I should not quit.

Back to work..
