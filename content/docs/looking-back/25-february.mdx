Lots of work. Trying to monetize this.

## February 16

Releasing 2 game projects soon. After that SolBond. Then GridChess, Then in parallel also my PrePrompt project (will be insane once built).

And after that, will move auth from Clerk to Better Auth for LA & will make LA incredible too.

That's the plan. üêø

I also [deleted past entries](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/docs/commit/adec6fd05c23306a8e8f76398b42208816e4e932) from this year's journal as they were too negative.

Life is hard and there is a lot of work every day at currently 0$ pay but I can't complain as that achieves nothing.

Just focus on the work. And ship a lot and ship fast. And share.

I also do want to take health, relationships more seriously.

I do love my daily core [habits](/habits) a lot. Trying to complete all every day.

Everything is accelerating as far as tech goes, its other keep up or just drop off. Have to be faster, a lot faster.
