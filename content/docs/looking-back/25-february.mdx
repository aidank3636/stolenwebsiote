## January 2

Lots of work. Still no money but work is done.

I also recently found out that a friend of mine sold his business for multiple millions and I can't even afford ramen.

Genuinely wonder why even try at this point, if nothing ever works out.

No one wants to hire me too. Genuinely useless. All I can hope for at this point is LLMs to get better and somehow use that to make at least something that earns enough money not to starve for most of the days.

Back to work..
