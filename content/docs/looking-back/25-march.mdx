## March 2

Joined [Jazz](https://jazz.tools) part time. Will work on sync and better dashboard amongst few other things.

Super excited and thrilled about this. It's great piece of tech that I am already starting to use for my PrePrompt tool (similar to [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com)).

Also Severance is absolutely amazing.

## March 9

Diaries are great. This one I do every Sunday but I write into personal diary nearly every day.

This week I was working on Jazz, trying to make sense of it better alongside getting projects I have on the side better.

Will share more things as they are ready.
