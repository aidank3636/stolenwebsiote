## January 7

2025 is exciting year in all things. It is also the year I set out to do weekly public logs which look like this in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things) as recurring task.

Year is starting off slow but there are concrete things I need to do, one of them is to release [SolBond](https://github.com/solbond/solbond).

Also I actually [published this new docs/wiki site](https://x.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1876279218763674056).

[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) is big inspiration in how much he and how he shares his work/learnings. And [brandur](https://brandur.org) is big inspiration for how to do long form writing well.

Got sick with hard cough and fever so couldn't work on anything.

Tried to make sense of [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org) & [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) as I try to move away from using [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for all things auth.

Still coughing but at least no fever. Not sure why cough is not going away.

I am super financially broke and stressed out. None of the projects I ever worked on have made any money.

I am thinking of selling learn-anything.xyz and all other things and maybe at least getting some money. I can probably get 30$ for it which is more than what I have now.

Can use it for cough medicine.

Cough is still not going away. ðŸ˜¿

Still 0$ on account. But it's been ongoing theme for past 6 years, some days it gets worse though like today.

But what can you do. No one wants to hire me, learn-anything whilst having users is bringing 0$. None of the other projects I worked on work well enough.

It would be wise to quit at this point or actually 6 years ago and go into construction or something that actually pays any money. But I decided to try myself at this computer thing, wrongly.

The even worse thing though is that my sister who is currently studying in university has no money to pay for her stay too so she will most likely will go home soon, no studies until money situation is resolved. If it even can be resolved.

I just hope I am still alive by end of next month, will see how it goes.
