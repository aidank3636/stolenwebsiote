## January 7

2025 is exciting year. It is also the year I set out to do weekly public logs which look like this in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things) as recurring task.

I also [published this new docs/wiki site](https://x.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1876279218763674056) this month with [FumaDocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/).

[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) is big inspiration in how much and how he shares his work/learnings. And [brandur](https://brandur.org) is big inspiration for how to do long form writing well.

Tried to make sense of [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org) & [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) as I try to move away from using [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for all things auth.
