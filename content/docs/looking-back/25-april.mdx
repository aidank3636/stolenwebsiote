More work. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opocWzPqo0g) live recording is great.

## April 13

Had my 30th birthday yesterday.

Would love to reflect more on this but there is just too much stress, stuff going on in life to really give it substance.

Majority of life for past year**s** has been just surviving mostly. Trying to earn enough money to just make it by, let alone have something fancy.

I do think I've learned few good things though. One is not to complain and another is ruthless focus on what is truly important and learning from mistakes.

I haven't written about it before, but in 2023 my lovely labrador Rachel passed away. She was quite old and I do think she had a great life but it is incredibly sad still.

I have this feeling about my parents too. They are not as old I think. My father is 53 years old but he does smoke daily and its a habit he seemingly can't drop.

Ever since Rachel's death, it does often feel like I am running against time. I do cherish a lot, every moment that I do spend with my family, friends and strangers too.

I also talked with a friend in Barcelona who got quite into fiction regarding future of humanity with respect to AI. Most of it is dystopian and a lot of the books (I am yet to read) are about digitizing consciousness.

Which I do think is kind of an inevitability given how tech like this already is starting to emerge. You can already map neurons of super small creatures, soon mice and with eventual exponential progress, humans.

This makes the whole feeling of running against time feel ever more real.

In anyway, some things are in my control and I will focus on them in my 30s. Mostly I just want to be kind, happy, healthy and those around me to feel the same.
