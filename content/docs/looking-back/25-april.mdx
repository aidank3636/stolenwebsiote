More work. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opocWzPqo0g) live recording is great.

## April 13

Had my 30th birthday yesterday.

I learned few good things thus far. One is not to complain and another is ruthless focus on what is truly important and learning from mistakes.

I haven't written about it before, but in 2023 my [lovely labrador Rachel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtOkHpSrbgd) passed away. She was quite old and I do think she had a great life but it is incredibly sad still.

Since Rachel's death, it often feels like I am running against time. My parents are aging and it's annoying that my dad still can't break his smoking habit. It's absurd.

I value and cherish a lot, every moment that I do spend with my family, friends and strangers too.

In my 30s, I will focus on things that do matter and be kind, happy and healthy. And hope others feel the same around me.

## April 20

I thought recently that I am not as active on X and I stopped sharing articles for things I am learning, I just do journals and many notes on topics.

I want to change it and start writing out actual notes/articles with clear titles and strucutre and goal.

I also want to maybe set some kind of deadlines or structure to it. Maybe one note every 3 days or in the least, one note per week.

Alos listened to [this interview](https://x.com/a16zcrypto/status/1913313573000061299) & its a nice overview on where agentic internet is going towards.

There is one agent that acts as a kind of firewall/orchestrator to other agents. You give it a task and it completes it. With Blockchain, you can let it use some funds on your behalf too.

He also says that websites are outdated in the long term. It will be agents talking to other agents mostly.

Will see. One thing is clear. There is many verticals that can be improved on given such thesis. Currently websites just started providing `llm.txt` files under some route & are only now starting to play around with MCPs.

Time to build smarter and faster.
