## May 5

Might be going to SF in June. Excited for [Local First conf](https://localfirstconf.com).

## May 11

Got my first ever US vistor visa. Other than that, more work.

## May 18

LA & SolBond's builds out soon. Start of something truly great.

## May 25

Writing this from Berlin. Tomorrow starts [Local First conf](https://www.localfirstconf.com).

LA is close to release and it is starting to look genuinely sick.

Soon it will be my primary note taking tool.
